# 🚀 Railway Deployment - FIXED Structure

## ✅ **Problem Solved!**

The issue was that your project files were inside a subdirectory (`WANAP/`), but Railway expects them to be in the root directory.

## 📁 **Corrected Structure**

Your deployment-ready files are now in `C:\UnAvgTech-Deploy\` with this structure:

```
UnAvgTech-Deploy/
├── app.py                    # ✅ Main Flask application
├── requirements.txt          # ✅ Python dependencies
├── Procfile                  # ✅ Railway deployment file
├── runtime.txt               # ✅ Python version
├── database.db               # ✅ SQLite database
├── .gitignore               # ✅ Git ignore rules

1. Download GitHub Desktop
2. Clone your repository
3. Copy all files from `C:\UnAvgTech-Deploy\` to the repository folder
4. Commit and push

**Option B: Using Git Commands**
```bash
cd C:\UnAvgTech-Deploy
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - UnAvg Tech Blog"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Option C: Using GitHub Web Interface**
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Add file" > "Upload files"
3. Drag and drop all files from `C:\UnAvgTech-Deploy\`
4. Commit changes

### **Step 3: Deploy to Railway**

1. **Go to Railway**

   - Start command: `python app.py`

4. **Add Environment Variables**
   - Go to Variables tab
   - Add these variables:
   ```
   FLASK_ENV=production
   SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-production-key-here
   ADMIN_USERNAME=your-admin-username
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-admin-password
   ```

5. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy" button
   - Wait for deployment to complete
